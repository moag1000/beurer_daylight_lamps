    ## Wake up naturally with simulated sunrise

    This blueprint creates a gentle wake-up experience by gradually increasing
    brightness and color temperature, simulating a natural sunrise. After the
    sunrise phase, the lamp maintains bright daylight for your therapy session.

    ### Features
    - Realistic sunrise colors (deep orange → warm white → daylight)
    - Smooth transitions between brightness levels
    - Configurable therapy duration at full brightness
    - Support for multiple lights (sync additional lamps)
    - Flexible scheduling (workdays, weekends, or daily)
    - Automatic abort if lights are turned off manually

    ### Recommended Settings
    - **Sunrise**: 15-20 minutes for a natural wake-up
    - **Therapy**: 20-30 minutes at full brightness (native white mode)

    > **Note**: This is a lifestyle/wellness feature, not a medical device.
